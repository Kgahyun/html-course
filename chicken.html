      The <b>chicken</b> <i>Gallus gallus domesticus</i> is a type of
      domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus).
      Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with
      a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018.[1] up from more than 19
      billion in 2011.[2] There are more chickens in the world than any other
      bird or domesticated fowl.[2] Humans keep chickens primarily as a source
      of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets.
      Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens
      were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries
      BC).
